Skiifreed2 dev notes
------------------------

enemies
 - trees
 - ENTs (walking trees)
 - snowmen
 - other skiiers (civvies)
   - civvie11
 - security guards 
   - "this mountain is closed"
 - police "stop skiing now!"
 - soldiers
 - secret service
 - UFO's (GODDAMN ALIENS)
   - aliens in mechs
 - ROBO MOUNTAIN LIONS
 - NINJA/ASSASSINS on skiis
 - Snowmobile terrorists
 - Cyborgs? Or are the skiiers part cyborg rebelling against their masters?

 - THE FABELLED BLACK YETI
   - our yeti turrns out to be good vs fighting black one

"Uncover the mysterious of the mountain... through the barrel  of a gun"

"**YETIS ARE ALLIES TO NO MAN**"

    Perhaps they are protecting the "Secret of the mountain" from the human government and you learn to build an alliance

 - snowboard/skii upgrades?
   - limited time usage powerups? Or like a shoot'em up and you get hit and lose upgrades.

 - lose health and then grab health pickups
 
 - if an ally goes down, is there a way for buddies to "BROTTHHERR!! GET BACK UP" and buddy pickup? Or is it simply they respawn like an old arcade game.


 - The further you go down the mountain the more "secrets" are revealed. Lighter stuff start off hidden (barely visible) and become more and more visible. Some guys are just curious, like a "totally not a fed" guy chopping wood next to a log cabin.

 - It tells a story as you keep going.

Watch Cabin in the woods? Never seen it.

possible story-line paths
 - befriend the yetis

Is santa involved? Yetis? Did immortal Santa plant the yetis to protect the mountain which contains the heart of the planet?

choose routes down the mountain
 - rocky pass
 - caves in the night!
 - WEATHER effects. Blizard storm. Maybe it turns out blizzards are a man-made creation to seed the earth for alien life. artifal snow generators!

so at this rate, the game is like a shoot'em up/survivor-like, with a silly crazy background story told both direct and environmental story telling.

Are powerups pickups, contra-drops, or purchases inbetween levels? Maybe inbetween level sections a SHOP car / van / Krieger-van blasts through from the side of the screen and lets you show up and buy stuff, or continue down the mountain. Maybe SHOCKING REVEAL about the DRIVER/TRADER later.

 - Customize the VAN like it's your support mothership? Add weapons, side cars with guns, etc.

Guns
====
  - AK-47 / M16
  - Rifles? (single shot might not work)
  - Shotguns
  - Flame Thrower
  - Rocket Launcher (rocket launcher from Commando )
  - Grenade launcher?
  - uzis
  - MINIGUN
  - any melee weapons? KATANNAA
  - other 80's/broforce stuff
  - GRENADES? Molotov Cocktails
  
Powerups???
===
 - make it like Vampire Survivors upgrades? / crimsonland on XP gain

maps
===
start top of mountain. Either go to multiple mountains or one long trail of segments.

into a mountain cave. perhaps we keep going deeper and end up in the alien incubation facility and E.T./x-files stuff
